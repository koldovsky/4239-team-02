              “I really like to please myself with good wine with a rich taste.
              Therefore, from time to time, I order wine directly from the
              CaliWines winery. I also buy Chardonnay and Cabernet for family
              holidays. We are completely delighted with the amazing taste of
              these wines, which we want to enjoy endlessly.”

              “We were to hold a responsible event with a buffet table and
              wanted to surprise our guests with some local products. I recalled
              that we have the CaliWines winery in California and ordered 10
              bottles of Chardonnay. Our guests were delighted and asked for the
              name of the producer!”

              years. We order the whole range of wines from them. We are
