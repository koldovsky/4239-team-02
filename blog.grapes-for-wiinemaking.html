      The most important thing in wine production is the quality of the
      grapes. Without this, it is impossible to make good wine. Therefore,
      there are a number of requirements for growing grapes to meet the
      requirements for winemaking.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
      Vintage wine cannot be made from grapes without prior selection,
      low-quality berries can ruin the whole taste. Special grape varieties
      are used for winemaking. They can be either red or white, depending on
      what kind of wine they plan to make from it. The grapes must be fully
      ripe, and they must be cut off strictly at a certain time so that they
      do not overripe.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
      Not all berries are suitable for making wine. For vintage wines, not
      only bunches are selected but also each berry. The berry should be large
      and fleshy. It must not be damaged in any way. Unripe or overripe
      berries are unacceptable.
