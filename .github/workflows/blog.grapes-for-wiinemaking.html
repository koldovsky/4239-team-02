        The most important thing in wine production is the quality of the
        grapes. Without this, it is impossible to make good wine. Therefore,
        there are a number of requirements for growing grapes to meet the
        requirements for winemaking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vintage wine cannot be made from grapes without prior selection,
        low-quality berries can ruin the whole taste. Special grape varieties
        are used for winemaking. They can be either red or white, depending on
        what kind of wine they plan to make from it. The grapes must be fully
        ripe, and they must be cut off strictly at a certain time so that they
        do not overripe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not all berries are suitable for making wine. For vintage wines, not
        only bunches are selected but also each berry. The berry should be large
        and fleshy. It must not be damaged in any way. Unripe or overripe
        berries are unacceptable.
