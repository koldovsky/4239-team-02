      Awards are the most important aspect for wines. If experts rate a
      particular wine highly, then it indicates that the production technology
      has been fully followed, and it is a really high-quality product. The
      award-winning wine is highly regarded by consumers as well.

      Therefore, producers regularly exhibit their wines at various
      competitions. The higher the status of the event, the tougher the
      competition, and, consequently, the more prestigious the award. The
      assessment is carried out by independent experts. During the assessment,
      the specialist evaluates the color of the product, its aroma, and
      structure. The last stage of the assessment is the assessment of taste.
      For each aspect, the wine receives a certain grade. The maximum score in
      the United States is 100 points.
